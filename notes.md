# Important notes
- key lookup in arrays returns index of consecutive elements not elements like in python
- pattern string lookup returns 0 if pattern was not found
- print function is crap ;_;
- `/(some string)/` is used instead of `/some string/` for string-wise lookup
- ** string contatenation operator is space ;_; **
- strings are beared by quotations
- all patters during function block lookup are searched, even after firs successful match
